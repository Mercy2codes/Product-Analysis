### Recommendations

Enhance iOS App Stability: The iOS version has higher crash rates across all regions, particularly in LATAM. Focus on identifying and resolving these issues to improve user experience and retention.

Optimize Onboarding and Engagement: While sign-up rates are strong, particularly in the APAC and US regions, focus on enhancing the onboarding process and user engagement strategies to convert more installs into active users and transactions.

Targeted Marketing Strategies: The LATAM region has lower app installs and user sign-ups. Consider region-specific marketing campaigns to boost visibility and attract more users.

Retention Strategies for Android Users: Android versions have higher install rates but also significant uninstall rates. Investigate the reasons behind these uninstalls and implement strategies to enhance user retention.

Leverage Peak Activity Days: With peak user activity varying by region, optimize content and promotional activities on these specific days to maximize engagement and conversions.

Continuous Monitoring and Feedback: Implement ongoing monitoring and user feedback mechanisms to quickly address issues and make necessary improvements to the platform.
